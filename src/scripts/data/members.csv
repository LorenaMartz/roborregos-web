69,Anel,Alvarado Gutiérrez,active,Electronics,,2020,1,"Hello! My name is Anel Beatriz Alvarado Gutiérrez, and I am currently studying Mechatronics. I’ve always had an interest in the robotics field, especially in how everything inside has a connection. When I started to dabble in robotics, I discovered that electronics explained how things are connected, so I started to learn more about it and got involved in projects.
During the week, I like to hang out with my friends, watch TV and read. My favorite hobby is photography, in which I’m always looking for new techniques and angles to create a memory.
One of my goals in life is to empower little girls and teenagers to get involved in the STEM area and make the gender gap smaller.",https://github.com/AnelAlvarado,AnelAlvarado,https://www.linkedin.com/in/anel-beatriz-alvarado-gutiérrez-497788196,"Electrical, Sensorial systems, Logic electronics, Power electronics, Networks and communication"
